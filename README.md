# Code-Wars
Here I have different codes for different problems that I have solved on Code-Wars. Not all problems are the same level.

And the code blocks here are just a part of the program/ just functions / part of the program that solves the problem / without main.

Please don't alternate the code of any problem, becouse that is my way of thinking and if you find yourself not liking the way I solved a problem try to solve it yourself on Code-Wars. 

Thank you!
